<h1>About Dance-X-Treme</h1>
<h5>
<i>When former competition dancers, George and Sue Weaver, set up 
Dance-X-Treme in 2008 neither of them imagined how popular it would become.</i></h5>
<p>Regular award winners George and Sue finally decided to retire from the rigours of 
competition dancing and start their own dance school. They now have a strong following of 
pupils that enjoy both Ballroom and Latin dancing.</p>
<p>
With Dance-X-Treme George and Sue have kept their passion for dance alive and from the success 
of the new school it's plain to see that they love teaching as much as they enjoyed competing. 
Attending any class for the first time can be a daunting experience for anyone and the Dance-X-Treme 
Team which comprises George, Sue and several dedicated helpers understands this and makes sure 
newcomers, are made to feel very welcome.

The Schools aim is to make sure pupils enjoy learning to dance and have fun.  It caters for all 
levels and capabilities from beginners, through intermediate to advanced. Beginners can quickly 
achieve a level where they feel confident to take to the dance floor at any social event there's 
nothing worse than going to a dance and not feeling able to join in. Improvers and advanced dancers 
enjoy picking up tips and new routines that add to their enjoyment of dance. George and Sue have 
particularly focused on providing a friendly and safe environment for dancers, helpers are always 
on hand to make single ladies or gentlemen feel comfortable and at ease.  Adding to this safe 
environment is the venue itself Coven Village Hall for instance has a spacious dance floor and 
safe off road parking.

Social dances organised by Sue and George have gained a reputation and sell out quickly. 
They are a great success with everyone enjoying the opportunity to use their new skills on the 
dance floor. As well as ballroom lessons, Dance-X-Treme has a lively latino mix class teaching 
Salsa, Cha Cha, Samba, Jive, Merengue and Rock n Roll.

George comments &quot;It doesn't matter where you are or how old you are, if there's music playing 
and you're confident just take to the dance floor for total satisfaction&quot;. To achieve total 
satisfaction at the next dance you go to, call George and Sue or just go along to any lesson and see 
for yourself. Happy dancing from Dance-X-Treme!
