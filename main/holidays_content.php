        <h1>Dance Holidays</h1>
    </div>

    <p>We organise several dance holidays throughout the year. 
    The itinerary generally starts with a social dance on Friday evening to get you warmed up. 
    Saturday continues the dancing with either a workshop or a trip to 
    Blackpool Tower Ballroom followed by a themed or formal dance in the evening.</p>
    <p>Booking forms and itinerary are available in class.<p>
    <p><strong>These holidays have proved very popular, 
    however there is limited availability at the hotel so please book early to avoid disappointment!</strong></p>
